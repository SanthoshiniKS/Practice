            Sundareshwarar, a form of Shiva.<img src="images.jpg" class="mdu1">The most striking feature of this shrine is its 14 majestic towers or Gopurams,
            displaying intricate carvings. Another captivating part of this Dravidian-style temple 
            is The Hall of Thousand Pillars, yet another example of architectural excellence.
            The Meenakshi Temple is the physical center of the city of Madurai as well as its economic, mythical, 
            and spiritual heart.The Meenakshi temple has two separate shrines for the goddess Meenakshi
            and god Sundaresvara, just like most Shaiva temples.Both open to the east. <br><br>
            The Devi shrine is on the south side , while the Deva shrine is more centrally placed, to the north,
            thus placing the goddess as the pradhana murti or the "more important" right side within the complex, 
            states Fuller.The shrine for Sundareswarar is the largest within the complex and its 
            entrance is aligned with the eastern gopuram.</p><hr style="border: 2px dotted #9900cc">

            seen many destructions over the passing decades.This palace was built with foliated brickwork, while the 
            polished texture of the palace came from the use of chunnam which is a combination of shell lime with egg white. 
            This palace is known for its majestic pillars, with height of about 82 feet and width of almost 19 feet. </p>
