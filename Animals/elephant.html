        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elephants are the largest existing land animals. Three living species are currently recognised: 
            the African bush elephant, the African forest elephant, and the Asian elephant. They are the only surviving members of the family Elephantidae and the order Proboscidea. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elephants are scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, 
            and Southeast Asia and are found in different habitats, including savannahs, 
            forests, deserts, and marshes. They are herbivorous, and they stay near water
            when it is accessible. They are considered to be keystone species, due to their
            impact on their environments. Elephants have a fission–fusion society, in which
            multiple family groups come together to socialise</p>
        <p>Elephants are the largest land mammals on earth and have distinctly massive bodies, 
            large ears, and long trunks. They use their trunks to pick up objects, trumpet warnings, 
            greet other elephants, or suck up water for drinking or bathing, among other uses. Both male 
            nd female African elephants grow tusks and each individual can either be left- or 
            right-tusked, and the one they use more is usually smaller because of wear and tear. 
            Elephant tusks serve many purposes. These extended teeth can be used to protect the elephant's trunk,
            lift and move objects, gather food, and strip bark from trees. They can also be used for defense. 
            During times of drought, elephants even use their tusks to dig holes to find water underground.</p>
