        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lion is a muscular, broad-chested cat with a short, rounded head, a reduced neck and round ears.
            Its fur varies in colour from light buff to silvery grey, yellowish red and dark brown. 
            <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new-born lion has dark spots, 
            which fade as the cub reaches adulthood.The tail of all lions ends in a dark, hairy tuft 
            that in some lions conceals an approximately 5mm long, hard "spine" or "spur" 
            that is formed from the final, fused sections of tail bone.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Skeletal muscles of the lion make up 58.8% of its body weight and represents the highest percentage of muscles among 
            mammals.The lion prefers grassy plains and savannahs, scrub bordering rivers and open 
            woodlands with bushes. It rarely enters closed forests.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            The lion is the most social of all wild felid species, living in groups of related individuals with their offspring. Such a 
            group is called a "pride". Groups of male lions are called "coalitions".
            The size and weight of adult lions varies across global range and habitats.The lion is a generalist hypercarnivore 
            and is considered to be both an apex and keystone predator due to its wide prey spectrum.
            Its prey consists mainly of ungulates weighing 190–550kg, particularly blue wildebeest,
            plains zebra, African buffalo, gemsbok and giraffe. They also hunt common warthog depending 
            on availability, despite weighing less than the preferred weight range.In India, chital and 
            sambar deer are the most common wild prey.</p>
