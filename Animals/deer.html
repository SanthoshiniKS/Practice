        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deer or true deer are hoofed ruminant mammals forming the family Cervidae.
            The two main groups of deer are the Cervinae, including the muntjac, the elk 
            (wapiti), the red deer, and the fallow deer; and the Capreolinae, including the
            reindeer (caribou), white-tailed deer, the roe deer, and the moose.
            <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Deer constitute the second most diverse family of artiodactyla after bovids.
            Though of a similar build, deer are strongly distinguished from antelopes by 
            their antlers, which are temporary and regularly regrown unlike the permanent 
            horns of bovids.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Characteristics typical of deer include long, powerful legs, 
            a diminutive tail and long ears. Deer exhibit a broad variation in physical 
            proportions. The largest extant deer is the moose, which is nearly 2.6 metres 
            tall and weighs up to 800 kilograms (1,800 lb).The elk stands 1.4–2 metres 
            at the shoulder and weighs 240–450 kilograms .The northern pudu is the smallest deer 
            in the world; it reaches merely 32–35 centimetres at the shoulder and weighs 3.3–6 
            kilograms. The southern pudu is only slightly taller and heavier.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Deer are native to all continents except Australia and Antarctica, and many species 
            have been widely introduced beyond their original habitats as game animals. 
            One species, the reindeer (also known as the caribou), has been domesticated. 
            Some swamp and island species are endangered, but most continental species are flourishing under
            protection and good management. Deer, when granted some protection, readily exploit man-made 
            disturbances caused by agriculture, forestry, and urbanization.
